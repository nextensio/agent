Welcome to Nextensio! 

Nextensio Client is a very light weight software that helps secure your enterprise traffic.
To install the client, please click on "install" Windows batch file found along with this guide. 
Windows will prompt you asking "do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device",
please answer yes.

Windows OS can be very finicky when it comes to allowing any security software, so below 
are a few steps that might be helpful

1. After installation, in the search bar you can search for "nextensio" to find and run the app.

2. When running the app a "Windows app defender" screen might pop up asking whether to allow the app to 
   access public networks. We certainly need public network/internet access :-). 
   So please select and allow Public networks. The Private network box can be left un-selected.

3. VPN agents (like open VPN or Private Internet Access) do not in general play well with other
   security software. So please ensure you disconnect any VPN before using Nextensio client.


Windows has many firewall and app allow/disallow knobs and settings, so in general if the client is
not working after the above simple steps, please ask your IT administrator to ensure 
that there is no firewall rules etc.. blocking the app. The app just needs regular SSL traffic to
standard https port 443, no other special requirements

Re-Installation: Windows requires the existing client to be uninstalled before a new version of 
client can be installed.
